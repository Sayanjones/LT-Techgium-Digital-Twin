# Digital Twin(Swing Machine)

This project implements a **Digital Twin** model for a **sewing machine in the textile industry**, utilizing simulated data from Engineering Technology (ET), Operational Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT) to predict machine behavior and visualize critical performance metrics.

This work was part of the **Techgium Challenge by L&T**, where the task was to develop a mathematical model for predicting machine requirements and analyzing real-time data to enhance performance.

## 📊 Project Overview

![Swing Machine Overview](swing-machine.jpg)

- **Goal:** Build a model that predicts machine requirements and visualizes parameters like torque, speed, vibration, and power.
- **Approach:**
  - ET, OT, and IT data generated using mathematical formulas.
  - Applied multiple regression models to analyze and predict machine performance.
  - Visualized results using Streamlit.
